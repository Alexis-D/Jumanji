* Improve isc_command_history (up/down command should have the same prefix)
* Pin tab ?
* Better private mode, not so easy:
                       - save cookies to another file (easy)
                       - prevent webkit to reload, navigate in the history (how ?)
                       - reload everything (not so easy : how to launch a new jumanji instance and destroy the current one when we are in single instance mode?)
